DOCUMENTATION TEMPLATE HTML GENERATOR
=====================================
A simple bash script documentation site generator.

FOLDER STRUCTURE
================

This is a simple way to organize a software/other things documentation.

documentation_folder
    \
     +- html/
        |- index.html
        |- files/
        '- style.css
     +- files-order.txt
     +- script.sh
     +- source/
        |- file1.html
        |- file2.html
        '- filen.html

Each source/*.html file is a section of the documentation.

 +-------
>|Each heading tag should have an id="" attibute to be rendered in the Table of Contents.
 +-------

The script.sh organizes everything and creates a one page in index.html with all
    the content, organized by section ID, with a table of contents in the left.


The toc.txt file contains the organization of the files, and this is the structure:

    +---------------------------+
    | # filename: toc.txt       |
    |                           |
    | # this is a comment       |
    |                           |
    | filename1.html            | \
    | filename2.html            | |>> this is the table of contents order.
    | filename3.html            | /
    +---------------------------+


And each file is a section with <h2 id="title-name">Title Name</h2> heading tag
